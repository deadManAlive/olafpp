# OLaF++
The **o**ffline (not-necessarily) **l**ine**a**r **f**ilter using primitive convolution algorithm (no transform).

The linear properties of the filter would be achieved by convolving input signal with symmetrical impulse array with length at least twice of the input signal.

Libraries used in this project.:

* `libsndfile`
